My second major python program, FlashCards.py is a simple command prompt based flash card game.  

The user can select from three built-in quizzes, or add a new flash card quiz from the internet or from their local hard drive. Note that new flash card games must be a raw text file in the format of:
Question:Answer
The questions and answers can be as long as needed, but there must be a semicolon between to tell the program where to delineate.  You will get an error message if program cannot read the file properly.

While playing the game, you can access the help menu at any time by typing "help".  You can also change the game by typing "change_cards" or change the number of attempts you get at a question by typing "change_attempts".  You can also type "Exit" to exit the program.

Hope you enjoy it!
